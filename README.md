# Scenario
Imagine you are a data engineer for a HR agency. Here's an overview of the business model of this agency:
Talent acquisition specialists work with different occupation fields. According to the opening job ads on
Arbetsförmedlingen, they will:
* Search and contact potential candidates from LinkedIn
* Contact and market those potential candidates to corresponding employers
Therefore, they constantly analyze job ads in order to understand which types of candidates they should
approach.
Currently, every begining of the week, they manually browse the homepage of
Arbetsförmedlingen and download a list of opening job ads to guide their work over the week. However,
they are not able to draw insights from these job ads as:
* The information are messy
* They have spent too much time to manually collect and clean data so that they do not have much time
to analyze the data, which is important to improve the efficiency of their work
